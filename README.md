## Usage Instructions

I sincerely hope the CtF Foot-End Multi-Dimensional Force Sensor can reach a wide audience and help anyone in need of high-precision foot-ground contact detection or multi-axis force sensingâ€”without being limited by the high cost of traditional strain-gauge-based sensors.

This repository includes:

Hardware: 3D models, titanium spring machining parameters, and material specifications;

Embedded PCB: Based on RP2040 + MLX90393, designed in LCSC EDA (an Altium Designer version will be provided in future updates);

Embedded Firmware: For sensor data acquisition and transmission;

PINN + MLP Algorithm Code: Runs on a personal PC for multi-axis force and contact-point estimation.

## How to Use

Hardware and PCB design files are provided in their respective folders;

Embedded firmware can be directly flashed to the RP2040;

Instructions for running the PINN + MLP algorithm are provided in a dedicated documentation file.
